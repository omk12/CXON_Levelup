# CXON_Levelup
# PCB Fault Detection Using AI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting faults in printed circuit boards (PCBs) using an AI-based image classification model. The model is trained on a dataset of faulty and non-faulty PCB images to automate the defect detection process.

## 🚀 Features
- AI-powered PCB fault detection
- Image classification for defect identification
- Automated quality inspection

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
- OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- Flask or Streamlit for deployment

## 🏗️ Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Train the AI model using the dataset.
3. Run the inference script to detect PCB faults.
4. Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time detection.
